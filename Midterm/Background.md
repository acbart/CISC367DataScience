# Midterm Project Proposal

## The Problem
The state of Delaware has a long and confounding history of school inequality. In order to repair this problem within the system, we first must recognize how drastic the dispairty is to start. I intend to compile a statistical analysis comparing several scool districts within Delaware on the basis of ethnic makeup, academic success, and funding recieved.

## My Questions
* How is funding distributed throughout differet districts in Delaware?
* Is there a significant correlation between amount of funding recieved and academic success?
* How to ethnic compositions of districts relate to funding recieved?

## The Importance
* Every child deserves fair and equitable opportunities for education, identifiying the disparities is key to starting this process.
* "Additional allocations that take into account the needs of students, such as low income and English Language Learner, is a necessary first step" - Education Equity Delaware Coaltiion
* "Funding equity in Delaware is long overdue. The education funding system, the core infrastructure for ensuring equitable allocation of resources, is more than 70 years old. It was built decades before desegregation and decades before the introduction of technology." - Rodel

## Data
[Delaware Student Enrollment](https://data.delaware.gov/Education/Student-Enrollment/6i7v-xnmf)

[Delaware Student Assesment Performance](https://data.delaware.gov/Education/Student-Assessment-Performance/ms6b-mt82)

[Delaware School Funding Reports](https://data.delaware.gov/Government-and-Finance/Revenue/it4a-m3yd)

## Concerns and Considerations
* It would be difficult to complete an in-depth anaylsis of every district in the state. Picking a sample will be necessary, leading to possible selection biases,
* There data sets listed above are all fairly large and contain complex categories that will need to be througly explained along side the analysis itself. 
* All data collected comes from official state resources.

## Ethical Concerns
One of the first major concerns faced in this research is striclty comparing students to monetary values. While looking at statistics suich as per-pupil expendatures can provide useful insights on school funding, it can also reduce students to nothing more than a dollar sign amount. It is critial to remember that students encompass much more than a sum of money throughout this research process. The second important consideration to make is where the money for school funding originate from. It is easy to say that school budgets should be increased, but we must also ensure this money does not come exploitative sources.
